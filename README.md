# Ultra-Marathon-Running-
This project explores ultramarathon running data in the US (2020, 50km/50mi) using Python for insights on:

Male vs. Female Speed (50km/50mi)
Top Age Groups (50mi, 20+ races)
Seasonal Performance (Summer vs. Winter)

**Gender Speed Gap:** I analyze and visualize the difference in speed between male and female runners in both 50km and 50-mile races.
**Age Group Dominance:** By focusing on 50-mile races with at least 20 participants per age group, I identify the age categories with the most successful runners.
**Seasonal Impact:** Investigated if there's a significant difference in runner performance across seasons (summer vs. winter) in ultramarathons.
